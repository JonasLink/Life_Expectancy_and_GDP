# Life_Expectancy_and_GDP
 
I am currently doing the Codecademy Data Science Career Path Course. This is my second self-directed python project. 

The goal of the project was to identify the relationship between GDP (Gross domestic product) and life expectancy in six countries.

The GDP and life expectancy data stems from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The six examined countries are Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, US and Zimbabwe.

To examine the relationship I used summary statistics, different charts (histograms, bar charts, line charts & scatterplots) & the Pearson Correlation
